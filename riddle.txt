Now here’s a secret you should find—
Open your eyes, don’t skim too fast.
Pay close attention, line by line,
Every first letter holds the past.

Nudge your mind to read between,
Order matters more than you think.
Think of this as a little scheme,

Take the start and link the ink.
Hidden truths lie in the start,
In every line, a clue to tell.
See what message beats your heart.

Only then the secret swells,
Notice how the letters flow,
Everyone can crack the code.

Look again and you will know,
Observe the start, it’s on the go,
Little hints are all aglow.
